# Machine Learning and Data Science Course Materials

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and other materials for a comprehensive course on Machine Learning and Data Science. This is a course I've been teaching since 2020. The materials cover a wide range of topics, from introductory Python programming to advanced machine learning algorithms.


## Course Contents

### Introduction and Fundamentals
- Introduction to Python
- Math for Machine Learning
- Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Pre-Processing

### Data Processing and Feature Engineering
- Missing Data Handling
- Imbalanced Learning
- Encoding Categorical Data
- Feature Engineering
- Transformations and PCA

### Supervised Learning
- Introduction to Supervised Learning
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Linear Regression and Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Decision Trees
- Ensemble Methods (Bagging and Boosting)

### Unsupervised Learning
- Clustering
- Unsupervised Learning Techniques

### Model Evaluation and Improvement
- Metrics, Evaluation, and Model Improvement

## Notebook Structure

The notebooks are organized by topic and follow a logical progression from basic to advanced concepts. Each notebook is prefixed with a code (e.g., AAV_01, 2023_1_AA) indicating its place in the course sequence.

## Usage

To use these materials:
1. Clone this repository
2. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed
3. Open the notebooks in order, starting with the introduction to Python

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of programming concepts
- Familiarity with mathematical concepts (linear algebra, calculus, statistics)
